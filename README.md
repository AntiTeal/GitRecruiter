# GitRecruiter

An Express.js web application that matches software developers with job listings based on their location and experience with specific programming languages and frameworks (pulled from their public GitHub profiles).

## Development setup

#### 1. Install Docker

- [Mac](https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/mac)
- [Windows](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows)

#### Once Docker is installed:

Run Docker, then use your Terminal/Command Prompt to see if everything's set up. 

**On both Linux/Mac and Windows:**

```
$ docker version
```

This should output something like:

```
Client:
 Version:      17.09.0-ce
 API version:  1.32
 Go version:   go1.8.3
 Git commit:   afdb6d4
 Built:        Tue Sep 26 22:40:09 2017
 OS/Arch:      darwin/amd64

Server:
 Version:      17.09.0-ce
 API version:  1.32 (minimum version 1.12)
 Go version:   go1.8.3
 Git commit:   afdb6d4
 Built:        Tue Sep 26 22:45:38 2017
 OS/Arch:      linux/amd64
 Experimental: true
```

### 2. Set up MySQL

We'll be using Docker to run MySQL.

#### Steps:
1. Open up Terminal/Command Prompt

2. Run the following command which installs and starts running your database (only run this command the first time): 
    ```
    docker run --name gitrecruiter-mysql -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=33YJ7DAdiBnaWi9r -d mysql:8.0
    ```
    You will see a long hash output, for example `e3fe6439f5a5577b28f6ef41dfcc6c0eda4262e7335b42384cd629fb9c6d7a01`. The content of this text doesn't matter.

    - The next time you need to run the database, simply type `docker start gitrecruiter-mysql` 

3. Type `docker ps`. Your Docker container should be running MySQL and you should see something like:
    ![docker ps](https://www.stewartdulaney.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2018/11/Screenshot-2018-11-11-00.28.03.png "docker ps")

### 3. Start the Express.js server

Note: these steps assume you have Node.js and npm installed. You can install both by downloading and running the installer [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

#### Steps:

1. Clone this repo
2. Open up Terminal/Command Prompt
3. Type `cd [PATH_TO_REPO_FOLDER_YOU_JUST_CLONED]`
4. Type `npm install` (only do this the first time)
5. Type `npm start`
6. Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:3000/
